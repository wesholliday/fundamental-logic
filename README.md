This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with supplementary material for the paper "A fundamental non-classical logic" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06993) by Wesley H. Holliday (wesholliday@berkeley.edu).

negation-axioms.ipynb verifies some basic facts about negations from Section 3 of the paper.

relational-frames.ipynb computes the algebras of fixpoints for the relational frames in Figures 11 and 12 of the paper and implements the representation of lattices with weak pseudocomplementations in Theorem 4.22.4 of the paper.
