proof-checker.ipynb contains a proof checker for the Fitch-style proof system defined in Section 2 of the paper.

negation-axioms.ipynb verifies some basic facts about negations from Section 3 of the paper.

relational-frames.ipynb computes the algebras of fixpoints for the relational frames in Figures 11 and 12 of the paper and implements the representations of lattices with additional operations in Theorem 4.23.4, Theorem 4.28, Theorem 6.3, and Theorem B.6.1 of the paper.

conditional-axioms.ipynb verifies some basic facts about conditionals from Section 6 and Appendix B of the paper.
